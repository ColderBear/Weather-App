Weather App using HTML CSS and Javascript

Welcome to the Weather App Project !!

Here is the summary of my project:

HTML Structure: It includes a search input field, a search button, and a display area for weather information. An error message is displayed in case of an invalid city name.

Functionality: It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using an API key. It allows users to enter a city name and click the search button to retrieve weather information. If a 404 error is returned from the API (indicating an invalid city name), it displays an error message. If the API call is successful, it displays weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

Weather Icons: The app displays weather icons corresponding to the weather conditions (e.g., clouds, clear, rain) based on the API response.

Styling: The app is styled using CSS, featuring a card-like layout with a gradient background. The search input and button are styled with rounded elements and hover effects.

Visibility Control: The app controls the visibility of elements, displaying the weather information and hiding the error message when weather data is successfully retrieved.
